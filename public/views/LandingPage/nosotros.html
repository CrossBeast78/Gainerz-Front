                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing 
                and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been 
                the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 
                1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of 
                type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
                It has survived not only five centuries, but also 
                the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining 
                essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 
                1960s with the release of Letraset sheets 
                containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently 
                with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker 
                including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

                Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply 
                random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin 
                literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. 
                Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney 
                College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure 
                Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, 
                and going through the cites of the word in classical 
                literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem 
                Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de 
                Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) 
                by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the 
                theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.
